# CI Workflow Best Practices

We have implemented several best practices to optimize our CI workflow:

- Workflow Status Badge: Added a workflow status badge to the README.md file for visibility.
- Build Cache: Utilized build cache to enhance workflow efficiency by caching dependencies and reducing build times.
- Optimized Steps: Each step in the workflow has been optimized for performance to ensure fast and reliable builds.

## Snyk Vulnerability Checks

We have integrated Snyk into our CI workflow to identify and address vulnerabilities in our Python project.

The Snyk vulnerability check is accomplished as a separate `security` job.
