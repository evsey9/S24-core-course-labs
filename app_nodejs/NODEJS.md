# Justification for Using Node.js

Node.js is a lightweight and efficient JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side scripting. It is well-suited for building scalable and high-performance web applications. The choice of Node.js for this web application is justified due to its event-driven architecture, which is beneficial for handling asynchronous operations such as fetching time data from different timezones.

## Best Practices and Coding Standards

- Project Structure: The application follows a standard Node.js project structure with a clear separation of concerns between the main application logic (index.js) and the views (index.ejs).
- Express Framework: The Express framework is used to simplify the development of the web application, providing routing and middleware functionalities.
- EJS Templating: The use of EJS templating allows for dynamic content rendering, promoting a clean separation of backend logic and frontend presentation.

## Testing and Code Quality

- Manual Testing: The application has been tested manually to ensure that the displayed time updates upon page refreshing.
- Code Review: Code has been reviewed to ensure adherence to JavaScript coding standards, including proper indentation, clear variable naming, and code readability.
