# Dockerization Best Practices

- Node.js Alpine Image: The Docker image uses the official Node.js 14 Alpine image, providing a lightweight and secure base for the application.
- Multi-Stage Build: The Dockerfile employs multi-stage builds. The first stage builds the application, and the second stage creates a lightweight runtime image. This reduces the final image size and limits potential security risks by excluding unnecessary build dependencies.
- Non-root User: The image runs the application using a non-root user by default, enhancing security.
- Precise Version of Base Image: The Dockerfile specifies a precise version of the Node.js Alpine image to ensure consistency and security.
